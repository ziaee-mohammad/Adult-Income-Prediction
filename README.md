# ðŸ§  Adult Income Prediction

### ðŸ“Š Project Overview  
This project predicts whether an adult earns more than *$50K/year* based on demographic and employment data from the *UCI Census Income dataset*.  
It applies several *classification algorithms* to explore and compare model performance.

### ðŸ§© Models Used  
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### âš™ Workflow  
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature selection and encoding  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Performance comparison using accuracy and confusion matrices

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights  
- Logistic Regression achieved competitive performance with efficient computation.  
- KNN performed well on balanced data but was sensitive to feature scaling.  
- SVM produced robust classification boundaries, showing strong predictive power.

### ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ [Census Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
